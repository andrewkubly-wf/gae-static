		<h1>Hello World - gae-static Project Demo</h1>
		<p class="intro"><img src="/assets/gae.png" class="gae-logo"/>
			This is a demo of serving a purely static website with Google App Engine on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_new">Google Cloud Platform</a>. It was created without a single line of a programming code and without fiddling with a command line! 
			<br /><br />
			Google App Engine is now a great hosting solution for simple websites as well as extremely complex applications. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/blainegarrett/gae-static" target="_new">gae-static</a> Github project to easily download the sample code to start your own static website. 
		</p>

		<h2>Project Highlights of gae-static</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Host assets (html, css, js, images, etc) anywhere in your site folder structure like normal web hosting</li>
			<li>Your directory roots serve up index.html files</li>
			<li>Does not require any knowledge of programming languages to get your site up an running</li>
			<li>Does not require to fiddle with the command line to deploy to Google Cloud.</li>
			<li>Easily develop your website on your own machine and deploy to Google Cloud.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<p>
			There are a couple steps to get your site on Google Cloud, but here is a thorough how-to for beginners.
		</p>

		<h3>Step1: Download gae-static</h3>
		<ol>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Setting up your Google Cloud Account</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google Cloud Developer Console</a> and create a new project.</li>
			<li>Enter a <b>Project Name</b> like <em>My Cool Website</em> and select an Project Id. Write this down, you'll need it in later steps. We'll use <em>mycoolsite</em> through the rest of this how-to.</li>
			<li>Once you create your application (you may need to refresh the page to see it listed), click on its name (e.g. <em>My Cool Website</em>). Ensure "App Engine" is listed in the column on the left</li>
			<li>You now have a website! You can view it at http://<em>mycoolsite</em>.appspot.com/ - You should see an error page with <em>The requested URL / was not found on this server.</em>. That is because we need to put your website there yet!
		</ol>

		<h3>Creating Your Static Website</h3>
		<p>Now that you are set up on Google Cloud Platform, lets get some content up there to serve</p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads">Download and install the Google Appengine SDK</a> - Pick the Python version since you won't be writing code - just be sure to pick your correct operating system.</li>
			<li>Once Installed, run the SDK (AppengineLauncher on Mac) and create a new project in the file menu. When asked for your <b>Application Id</b>, enter the Project Id you used above (e.g <em>mycoolsite</em>)</li>
			<li>This will now create a folder named <em>mycoolsite</em> wherever you selected it to live.</li>
			<li>Click <b>Deploy</b> in the SDK program. You'll need to enter the username and password you used when you set up your application on Google Cloud Platform.</li>

			<li>Go to your brand new website at http://<em>mycoolsite</em>.appspot.com/</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The Important Bits - app.yaml</h2>
		<p>
			There are only two critical things to have when setting up your project: the <i>app.yaml</i> and the <i>www</i> folder. Here are the basics of your app.yaml file:
		</p>
		<pre>
application: gae-static
version: 1
runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: yes

error_handlers:
- file: 404.html

# index files
handlers:
- url: /(.+)/
  static_files: www/\1/index.html
  upload: www/(.+)/index.html

# site root
- url: /
  static_files: www/index.html
  upload: www/index.html

# For folders without trailing slashes - ideally a 301 redirect, but we're static & it isn't 2004
- url: /([^\.]+)([^/])
  static_files: www/\1\2/index.html
  upload: www/(.+)

# Redirect Everything else
- url: /(.+)
  static_files: www/\1
  upload: www/(.+)
		</pre>
		
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>The <a href="/assets/gae.png">App Engine icon</a> at the top of the page is served up statically.</p>

		
		<h2>Example Folder Structure</h2>
		<ul id="nav">
			<li>
				<a href="/">/ (root - this page)</a>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/page.html">page.html</a></li>
					<li><a href="/folder1/">folder1/</a>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="/folder1/page.html">page.html</a></li>
							<li><a href="/folder1/folder11/">folder11/</a>
								<ul>
									<li><a href="/folder1/folder11/page.html">page.html</a></li>
									</li>
								</url>
							</li>
						</ul>	
					</li>
				</url>					
			</li>
